## Libraries Used
* glm 0.9.9.8 https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/tag/0.9.9.8
* GLFW 3.3.6 https://www.glfw.org/download.html
* glad https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad
    - "Go to the GLAD web service, make sure the language is set to C++, and in the API section 
    select an OpenGL version of at least 3.3 (which is what weâ€™ll be using; higher versions are 
    fine as well). Also make sure the profile is set to Core and that the Generate a loader option 
    is ticked. Ignore the extensions (for now) and click Generate to produce the resulting library 
    files". Quote copied from "Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming" by Joey de Vries
